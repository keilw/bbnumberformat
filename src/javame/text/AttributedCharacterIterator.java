/**
 * An AttributedCharacterIterator allows iteration through both text and related
 * attribute information.
 * 
 * <p>
 * An attribute is a key/value pair, identified by the key. No two attributes on
 * a given character can have the same key.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The values for an attribute are immutable, or must not be mutated by clients
 * or storage. They are always passed by reference, and not cloned.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A <em>run with respect to an attribute</em> is a maximum text range for
 * which:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the attribute is undefined or null for the entire range, or
 * <li>the attribute value is defined and has the same non-null value for the
 * entire range.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A <em>run with respect to a set of attributes</em> is a maximum text range
 * for which this condition is met for each member attribute.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The returned indexes are limited to the range of the iterator.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The returned attribute information is limited to runs that contain the
 * current character.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Attribute keys are instances of AttributedCharacterIterator.Attribute and its
 * subclasses.
 * 
 * @see AttributedCharacterIterator.Attribute
 * @see AttributedString
 * @see Annotation
 * @since 1.2
